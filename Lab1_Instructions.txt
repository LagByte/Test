                         CS 1430 - Lab 1
LAB:      1
DUE DATE: 1/28/2016, 5:00PM
GRACE DATE: 2/3/2016, 5:00PM

===========================================================================
Please read this entire file before beginning!

Lab1.cpp is a PARTIAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM LISTED BELOW.  
Look for lines in the program that start with the string "//DO" to locate
specific tasks that need to be completed for this lab.  There are eight (8)
of these tasks.

After creating a new C++ project, right click the "Source Files" in the Solution 
Explorer and click Add -> Existing Item, to add Lab1.cpp to the project.
Select "Build Solution" or F7 to compile Lab1.cpp.  You should see errors on line 35.

VisualStudio is currently highlighting the '<<'. This should be `>>' since we want
to read the value of the integer from the user.  Fix this error.  In this
case, the error message was right where the error actually occurred.
Often, however, you need to look elsewhere on the current line or previous
line to find what needs to be fixed.

Save your program, rebuild it to verify the fix you 
implemented was correct.  You should generally save significant changes 
to your program before you attempt compile or run it, 
otherwise you might lose your work due to unexpected problems.

From the DEBUG menu, select "Start Without Debuging" or Ctrl-F5 to run the program.
Enter values after prompts for number1 and value for number2.  

===========================================================================

Complete Lab1.cpp to compute and print the integer quotient, the float
quotient, and the integer remainder of two inputed integers.
The program should adhere to the following pseudocode:

    1.  Read first integer number and second integer number.
    2.  Calculate the integer quotient.
    3.  Display the results of the integer quotient.         (//DO 04)
    4.  Calculate the float quotient.                        (//DO 05)
    5.  Display the results of the float quotient.           (//DO 06)
    6.  Calculate the integer remainder (modulo arithmetic). (//DO 07) 
    7.  Display the results of the modulo operation.         (//DO 08)  
	
IMPORTANT HINT:
Steps 1. and 2. are already carried out in the program on lines
30-37. 
	  
Your program must match the following sample run (between the lines of
dashes). Note that the 7 and 4 on the first two lines were entered by the
user.

-------------------Example output between dashed lines when running from Visual Studio-------
Enter the first integer: 7
Enter the second integer: 4


Using integer division, 7 / 4 = 1.
Using floating-point division, 7 / 4 = 1.75.
7 modulo 4 = 3.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
  - Get help if you're stuck or spinning wheels!
  - Your output MUST contain blank lines in the same places as 
    above output.
  - Test your program on other values as well.

===========================================================================

When you're finished testing your program on your own inputs, submit it to
the grader.  The grader will run your program on some sample inputs and
count the number of errors or differences between your output and the desired
output.  For labs, you must have 0 output errors to receive credit.  

You can resubmit as many times as needed.  Your score will be based on the
last submission ONLY.

Make sure that you save your work on your 'J' 
drive or memory stick as you may find some of this work usefull in future 
programs.
